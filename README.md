# rusty-man

```
$ rusty-man rusty-man | head -4
rusty-man                                 Module rusty-man                                 rusty-man

DESCRIPTION
      rusty-man is a command-line viewer for documentation generated by `rustdoc`.
```

## Example Usage

Before running rusty-man, make sure that you generated the documentation with
`cargo doc`:
```
$ cd rusty-man && cargo doc
```

Then you can open the documentation for an item:
```
$ rusty-man kuchiki::NodeRef
```

You don’t have to specificy the full item name:
```
$ rusty-man NodeRef
```

If the documentation is not placed in `./target/doc` or
`/usr/share/doc/rust{,-doc}/html`, you have to manually set the source path
using the `-s`/`--source` option:
```
$ rusty-man --source ~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-*/share/doc/html io::Error
```

If there are multiple matches for the keyword, rusty-man will show you a list
of all matching items:
```
$ rusty-man --source ~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-*/share/doc/rust/html u8
Found mulitple matches for u8 – select one of:

[ 0 ] core::u8: The 8-bit unsigned integer type.
[ 1 ] std::u8: The 8-bit unsigned integer type.

> 1
```

For more usage information, run `rusty-man --help`.
