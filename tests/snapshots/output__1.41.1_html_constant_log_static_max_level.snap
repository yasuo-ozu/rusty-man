log                                Constant log::STATIC_MAX_LEVEL                          rusty-man

SYNOPSIS
      pub const STATIC_MAX_LEVEL: LevelFilter

DESCRIPTION
      The statically resolved maximum log level.
      
      See the crate level documentation for information on how to configure this.
      
      This value is checked by the log macros, but not by the `Log`ger returned by the `logger`
      function. Code that manually calls functions on that value should compare the level against
      this value.
