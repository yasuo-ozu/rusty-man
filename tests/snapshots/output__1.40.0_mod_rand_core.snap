DESCRIPTION
      Random number generation traits
      
      This crate is mainly of interest to crates publishing implementations of [`RngCore`]. Other
      users are encouraged to use the [`rand`][1] crate instead which re-exports the main traits and
      error types.
      
      [`RngCore`] is the core trait implemented by algorithmic pseudo-random number generators and
      external random-number sources.
      
      [`SeedableRng`] is an extension trait for construction from fixed seeds and other random
      number generators.
      
      [`Error`] is provided for error-handling. It is safe to use in `no_std` environments.
      
      The [`impls`] and [`le`] sub-modules include a few small functions to assist implementation of
      [`RngCore`].

MODULES
      block
            The `BlockRngCore` trait and implementation helpers

      impls
            Helper functions for implementing `RngCore` functions.

      le
            Little-Endian utilities

STRUCTS
      Error
            Error type of random number generators

      OsRng
            A random number generator that retrieves randomness from from the operating system.

TRAITS
      CryptoRng
            A marker trait used to indicate that an [`RngCore`] or `BlockRngCore` implementation is
            supposed to be cryptographically secure.

      RngCore
            The core of a random number generator.

      SeedableRng
            A random number generator that can be explicitly seeded.
