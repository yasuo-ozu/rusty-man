log                                 Function log::set_logger_racy                          rusty-man

SYNOPSIS
      pub unsafe fn set_logger_racy(
          logger: &'static dyn Log
      ) -> Result<(), SetLoggerError>

DESCRIPTION
      A thread-unsafe version of `set_logger`.
      
      This function is available on all platforms, even those that do not have support for atomics
      that is needed by `set_logger`.
      
      In almost all cases, `set_logger` should be preferred.
      
      # Safety
      
      This function is only safe to call when no other logger initialization function is called
      while this function still executes.
      
      This can be upheld by (for example) making sure that **there are no other threads**, and (on
      embedded) that **interrupts are disabled**.
      
      It is safe to use other logging functions while this function runs (including all logging
      macros).
